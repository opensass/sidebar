## 📜 Intro

Sidebar is a **highly optimized**, **feature-rich** sidebar component built for **WASM-based frameworks** like **Yew**, **Dioxus**, and **Leptos**. It supports nested menus, user profiles, collapsibility, submenus, badges, and full styling control.

## 🤔 Why Use Sidebar?

These standout features make Sidebar the best choice for any WASM UI:

1. **🎛️ Full Customization**: Every part, menu items, header, logo, profile, layout, is styleable via props.
1. **🧱 Modular Design**: Use only the pieces you need: `Sidebar`, `Menu`, `MenuItem`, `Submenu`, `Profile`, or `Logo`.
1. **🔁 Dynamic Interaction**: Update the selected menu item using `UseStateHandle` or attach `on_logout` handlers.
1. **🧩 Composable**: Nest submenus, inject icons, or toggle visibility based on context.
1. **📐 Accessible UI**: Designed with screen readers in mind.
